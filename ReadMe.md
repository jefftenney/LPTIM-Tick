# LPTIM-Tick
*FreeRTOS Tick/Tickless via LPTIM*

Use LPTIM for the FreeRTOS tick instead of the SysTick Timer for ultra-low-power applications.

- No drift or slippage in kernel time
- Use STOP modes even while FreeRTOS timers are running or delays are underway
- For any STM32 with LPTIM (STM32L, STM32F, STM32G, STM32H, STM32U, STM32W)

This repository demonstrates integration and testing of the [lptimTick.c gist](https://gist.github.com/jefftenney/02b313fe649a14b4c75237f925872d72) on [Nucleo-L476RG](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l476rg.html) (STM32L476).  The project uses STM32CubeIDE and its integrated code-generation tool (STM32CubeMX).  However, lptimTick.c is compatible with any toolchain supported by FreeRTOS.

A separate repository, [LPTIM-Tick-U5](https://github.com/jefftenney/LPTIM-Tick-U5), is adapted to the STM32U family.

For a thorough evaluation, this project can be built without tickless idle, with the default tickless idle, or with the custom tickless idle provided by lptimTick.c.  See branches for additional evaluation options.

## Nucleo-L476RG Demo

Press the blue button to cycle between tests:
1. Maintain kernel time only.  LED blinks every 5 seconds.
2. Validate tick timing.  LED blinks every 2 seconds.
3. Stress test tick timing.  LED blinks every second.

Tests 2 and 3 display live test results to a serial terminal.  Connect to the STLink Virtual COM Port at 115200 8N1.  Additionally, the LED blinks twice (instead of just once) in case of test failure.

## Test Results
*Current readings shown are averages, *not* including the LED*

__With lptimTick.c (`configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE 2`)__

- Test 1: 2μA, no drift
- Test 2: 55μA, no drift
- Test 3: 110μA, no drift

__Default tickless idle (`configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE 1`)__

- Test 1: 3.70mA, trivial drift
- Test 2: 3.72mA, trivial drift
- Test 3: 3.74mA, trivial drift (with kernel v10.5.1 or newer)

__Tickless disabled (`configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE 0`)__

- Test 1: 9.86mA, no drift
- Test 2: 9.86mA, no drift
- Test 3: 9.86mA, no drift

## Integrating lptimTick.c into your project

1. Add [lptimTick.c](https://github.com/jefftenney/LPTIM-Tick/blob/main/Core/Src/lptimTick.c) to your project folder, configuration, and/or makefile.
1. In FreeRTOSConfig.h, define `configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE` to `2`, and eliminate the preprocessor definition for `xPortSysTickHandler`.  If using LSI instead of LSE, define `configTICK_USES_LSI` and `configLPTIM_REF_CLOCK_HZ` (typically `32000` or `37000`), too.
1. Update the [#include](https://github.com/jefftenney/LPTIM-Tick/blob/5ca1c2ee5878479d2c5c1bac3c8f6a6ae2dea7eb/Core/Src/lptimTick.c#L32) for your MCU.
1. Update the LPTIM [instance selection](https://github.com/jefftenney/LPTIM-Tick/blob/5ca1c2ee5878479d2c5c1bac3c8f6a6ae2dea7eb/Core/Src/lptimTick.c#L255-L257).  (For STM32WL users, [here](https://github.com/jefftenney/LPTIM-Tick/blob/5ca1c2ee5878479d2c5c1bac3c8f6a6ae2dea7eb/Core/Src/lptimTick.c#L289) too.)  LPTIM1 is the default.
1. Update the [initialization code](https://github.com/jefftenney/LPTIM-Tick/blob/5ca1c2ee5878479d2c5c1bac3c8f6a6ae2dea7eb/Core/Src/lptimTick.c#L275-L279) that is specific to both the MCU family and the LPTIM instance.
